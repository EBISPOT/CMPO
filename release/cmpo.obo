comment: Example: 'Lewy bodies increased number related to dystrophic neurite increased number' (from annotation of PMID:8740227 in http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/1.0/NDPO.owl#ndpo_404). Here the increase in the number of lewy bodies is directly_associated_with the increase in the number of dystrophic neurites.\nAssociation is weaker than correlation or proportionality. These relations may be later added to PATO.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.
